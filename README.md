## Text Summarization

####  TWO TYPES OF SUMMARIZATION

- Abstractive Summarization: <br /> 

 Input document → understand context → semantics → create own summary. <br />

- Extractive Summarization: <br />

Input document → sentences similarity → weight sentences → select sentences with higher rank. <br />

### I am using generate extractive summarization.
